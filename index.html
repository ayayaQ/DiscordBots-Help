    <h2 id="creating-commands">Creating Commands</h2>

    <p>First, navigate to the commands section and press the floating action button in the bottom right. This opens a
        menu to create your commands</p>

    <p>You can use the dropdown menu to select which type you want for your command.</p>

    <p>The command field is used for what will trigger the command.<br><b>NOTE 1:</b> * in the command field will mean
        anything will trigger the command.<br><b>NOTE 2:</b> For custom emojis in the reaction add type you will use the
        name of the emoji (eg. your emote is named WeirdChamp, you would then put WeirdChamp), and regular emojis will
        just use the emoji ðŸ˜Š in the command field. </p>

    <p>Phrase means what is in the command field can appear anywhere in a message to trigger a command. Eg. Command is
        "hello" with phrase checked, if someone says "Hello there!" the command will trigger.</p>

    <p>The command description field is optional and can be used to remind you what a command does.</p>

    <p>Channel message will send a message in the channel where the command is triggered. You can use <a
            href="#keywords">keywords</a> in this field. </p>

    <p>Private message will send a private message to someone who triggers a command. You can also use <a
            href="#keywords">keywords</a> in this field.</p>

    <p id="moderation">The moderation section (kick, ban, voice mute) works in a special way. Usage is whatever your
        command is with a
        mention directly after it. For example if you had kick checked and named your command "remove" you would call it
        will "remove @user" to kick the user.</p>

    <p>Assign/Remove Role can assign and remove roles. The role name field is case sensitive and must match the name of
        the roles you want to assign. When this command is called the first time, it adds the roles to the user who
        called it. On the second time, it removes the role from the user who called it.</p>

    <h2 id="keywords">Keywords</h2>

    <p>Keywords are used to create more dynamic messages for your commands. They go into the output fields of your
        command like channel message or private message. Here is a list of the available ones. <b>NOTE: * is an
            exception. It is a wildcard keyword for the command field. This means any message or reaction can trigger
            your
            command.</b> </p>

    <p> <b>$name (Compatible with all except member leave and member ban)</b> - This mentions the user who sent the
        message. NOTE: If you use it in the
        channel send part of an event where the user leaves you will receive an invalid user mention. <br><br>
        <b>$channel (Compatible with Message Received)</b> - Adds the channel
        name to the message.<br><br> <b>$server (Not compatible with Private Message Received) </b> - Adds the server
        name to the message <br><br> <b>$message (Compatible with Message Received and Private Message Received)</b> -
        This adds the message content of the message sent. <br><br> <b>$rollnum(min,max) (Compatible with all)</b> -
        This generates a random
        number where you replace min with the smallest number and max with the largest one. For example, if you made a
        dice command that uses $rollnum(1,6) it would show replace where you put the $rollnum(1,6) with the result. If
        your command was to reply with "$rollnum(1,6) is the roll of your dice." it would appear as below. </p> <img
        src="https://github.com/ayayaQ/DiscordBots-Help/blob/master/docs/Annotation%202019-11-16%20214354.png?raw=true" />
    <p> But if you made a mistake in your command and put in a number larger than the max in the min spot like
        "$rollnum(55,12)" You could get an error that appears like so. </p> <img
        src="https://github.com/ayayaQ/DiscordBots-Help/blob/master/docs/Annotation%202019-11-16%20214831.png?raw=true" />
